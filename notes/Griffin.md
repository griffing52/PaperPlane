# What I did if you're unsure

This is how I created the project 

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
```
Usually you can just say 

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

but I was just trying a couple of other things.

And I set the package name to paperplane, choosing React as the framework, with TypeScript, no rolldown-vite because I didn't know what that was and it said it was experimental, and finally I said yes to install with npm and start now.

As a note, I used Vite because it is a pretty fast and simple (and more modern) build system for React that doesn't really change the process that much--and I saw Tobias using it in one of his examples so I assume it was okay.
